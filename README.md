# 3MTTKnowledgeShowcase
#My3MTT #3MTTLearningCommunity
A storage platform to showcase my skill acquisition progress in the FGN's 3MTT program cohort 3.
I joined the program as a complete novice of data analysis. Though excited as I commence the journey expectantly, I struggled through the first few weeks in effectively managing my daily life with demanding program deliverables that are mainly hands-on practical projects.
Now, after getting some confidence in the data analysis space from continuous practices in the program, I have this opportunity of participating in real-time competition to test and weigh my mettles against other Techies!!!
It is a great opportunity that would open further collaboration chances for me, as I keep growing in the Tech profession.
